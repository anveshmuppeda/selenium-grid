Kubernetes Selenium Grid with KEDA

## What is Selenium-Grid?
Selenium-Grid allows you run your tests on different machines against different browsers in parallel. That is, running multiple tests at the same time against different machines running different browsers and operating systems. Essentially, Selenium-Grid support distributed test execution

## When should testers use Selenium Grid?
Testers should use Selenium Grid in the following circumstances:
1. To run tests on multiple browsers and their versions, different devices, and operating systems
2. To reduce the time that a test suite takes to complete execution.  

Selenium Grid improves the turnaround time of the test results. It is especially useful when the test suite is large and takes more time to run. It offers flexibility and ensures maximum test coverage within a limited time. Since the virtual infrastructure is in use, maintenance becomes easy.
